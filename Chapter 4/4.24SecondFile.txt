When the morning came we
Were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend

"How'd we end up on the floor anyway?" You say 
"Your roommate's cheap ass screw top Rose, that's how"
I see you everyday now

And I chose you 
The one I was dancing with
In London, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was

The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet it was 
Maroon
