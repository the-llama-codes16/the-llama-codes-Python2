   1> Lists
   2> A list is a sequence of data values called items or elements. An item can be of any type.
   3> Here are some real-world examples of lists:
   4> •• A shopping list for the grocery store
   5> •• A to-do list
   6> •• A roster for an athletic team
   7> •• A guest list for a wedding
   8> •• A recipe, which is a list of instructions
   9> •• A text document, which is a list of lines
  10> •• The names in a phone book
  11> The logical structure of a list resembles the structure of a string. Each of the items in a list is
  12> ordered by position. Like a character in a string, each item in a list has a unique index that
  13> specifies its position. The index of the first item is 0, and the index of the last item is the
  14> length of the list minus 1. As sequences, lists and strings share many of the same operators,
  15> but they include different sets of methods. We now examine these in detail.
