Lists
A list is a sequence of data values called items or elements. An item can be of any type.
Here are some real-world examples of lists:
•• A shopping list for the grocery store
•• A to-do list
•• A roster for an athletic team
•• A guest list for a wedding
•• A recipe, which is a list of instructions
•• A text document, which is a list of lines
•• The names in a phone book
The logical structure of a list resembles the structure of a string. Each of the items in a list is
ordered by position. Like a character in a string, each item in a list has a unique index that
specifies its position. The index of the first item is 0, and the index of the last item is the
length of the list minus 1. As sequences, lists and strings share many of the same operators,
but they include different sets of methods. We now examine these in detail.
