The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period
in a text file. The format of each line of the file is the following:
<last name> <hourly wage> <hours worked>
Write a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints to the terminal a
report of the wages paid to the employees for the given period. The report should
be in tabular format with the appropriate header. Each line should contain an
employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked, and the wages paid for that period.

# Introduce the program
print("""This program prompts for the name of a payroll file and prints
the payroll table in a format.""")

# Get user input
payroll_file = input("Enter payroll file name: ")
if not(".txt" in payroll_file):
    payroll_file = payroll_file + ".txt"

# Open and read file
fhand = open(payroll_file, 'r')

# Print table
print("%10s  %s  %s" % ("Last Name", "Hours Worked", "Wages Paid"))
for line in fhand:
    clean_data = (line.rstrip()).split()
    name = clean_data[0]
    hourly_wage = float(clean_data[1])
    hours_worked = float(clean_data[2])
    wages_paid = hourly_wage * hours_worked
    print("%10s  %8.2f     %10.2f" % (name, hours_worked, wages_paid))
