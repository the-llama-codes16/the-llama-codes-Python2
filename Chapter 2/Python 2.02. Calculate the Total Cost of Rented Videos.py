Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who 
like to buy LP record albums. The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and 
oldies for $2.00 a night. Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video 
can use to calculate the total charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals. The program 
should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total 
cost.

Input:
(int) newVideos
(int) oldies

Output:
(float) totalCost

#User Input
newVideos = int(input("Number of new videos rented: "))
oldies = int(input("Number of old videos rented: "))

#Calculate Total Cost
totalCost = (newVideos * 3.00) + (oldies * 2.00)

#Display Total Cost
