Lee has discovered what he thinks is a clever recursive strategy for printing the
elements in a sequence (string, tuple, or list). He reasons that he can get at the
first element in a sequence using the 0 index, and he can obtain a sequence of
the rest of the elements by slicing from index 1. This strategy is realized in a
function that expects just the sequence as an argument. If the sequence is not
empty, the first element in the sequence is printed and then a recursive call is
executed. On each recursive call, the sequence argument is sliced using the
range 1:. Here is Leeâ€™s function definition:

def printAll(seq):
    if seq:
        print(seq[0])
        printAll(seq[1:])

Write a script that tests this function.

# Introduce the program
print("""This program tests a recursive function for printing the elements in a sequence.""")

# Define the function
def printAll(seq: list):
    if len(seq) > 0:
        print(seq[0])
        printAll(seq[1:])


# Test the function
sample = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
printAll(sample)
