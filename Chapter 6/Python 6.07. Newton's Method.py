Package Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots (Case Study 3.6) in a
function named newton. This function expects the input number as an argument
and returns the estimate of its square root. The script should also include a main
function that allows the user to compute square roots of inputs until she presses
the enter/return key.

# Define the function
def NewtonMethod(num):
    """This function takes a number and returns its squareroot using Newton's
    method."""
    # Ensure that input is positive
    if (num < 0):
        num = abs(num)
    # Set initial guess
    z = 1
    # This chapter is about recursion, so we do this the recursive way
    def NewtonMethodRecursive(num, z):
        if (num - pow(z,2) > 0.001):
            z = (z + num/z)/2
            NewtonMethodRecursive(num, z)
        else:
            return z

    using Newton's Method.\n""")
